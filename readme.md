# FriendFinder

## Summary

A simple app that lets you take a survey of ten questions, and matches you with a "friend" that is the most similar to your personality and tastes!

All you have to do is put in your name, an image, and answer the questions that feel suit you the most, and hit submit. The app goes through an API of pre-existing and previous users and matches you, based on the scores you chose, to the user whose total creates the least difference with your own total.

## Technologies Used

This was an extensive exercise in routing, multiple paths, building a server that can handle requests and send out responses, as well as a front-end "client" user interface that creates the requests. Node, Express, Path, Array-Sort, and basic UI technologies such as HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap and front-end Javascript for handling events that the user would be creating in order to "communicate" with the server.

For this we had to have solid understanding of GET and POST requests, as well as creating API and HTML routes to handle the server-side response creation.

And finally, we learned to deploy in Heroku for the first time in order to create a live application for others to actually use!

## Comments

This was by far the most challenging assignment I have tackled. I did ask for help a lot, between my fellow students as well as my instructor. Some problems I ran across were beyond my current skill level "ie. 'Resource interpreted as Stylesheet but transferred with MIME type text/html,' which continuously prevented my CSS and image files to show up when deployed. In this case, I researched tirelessly as well as asked my instructor for help to solve the issue.
